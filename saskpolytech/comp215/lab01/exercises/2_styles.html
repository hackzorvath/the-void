    <p style="font-family:times;color:blue;">Competitive Pokémon fans were treated to quite the surprise during the 2025 Pokémon World Championships, with The
      Pokémon Company officially announcing that Pokémon Champions will be the official home of the Pokémon VGC during
      the 2025 season.

      Initial confusion turned into pure excitement in the Anaheim Convention Center as a new Pokémon Champions trailer
      confirmed the game would be part of the 2026 Play! Pokémon circuit as the official VGC software, replacing Pokémon
      Scarlet and Violet. We also got a few glimpses at just what Champions has in store with some extra info.
