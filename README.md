## 🌌 Premise

Welcome, wayward traveller of the web, to **enter_the_void** — a static-site experiment that straddles the line between classroom and cabaret.  
What began as a modest course hub has metastasized into something delightfully unruly: a portal of links, lectures, and luminous nonsense, all wrapped in the spectral silk of Saskatchewan Polytechnic’s palette.  

Here the author, performer, and professor (that’s me) collects the many acts of my digital life:
- 💻 **Teaching stages** — course pages, project showcases, and assorted props from the front of the lecture hall.  
- 🕹️ **Game experiments** — prototypes from *Pocket Earldom*, *Floaty Boats 2k26*, and other bouts of pixelated pandemonium.  
- 📚 **Philosophical interludes** — excerpts from *Jack’s Rules for Playing the Game of Life*, written between bouts of caffeine and clarity.
