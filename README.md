# 🎭 enter_the_void

**A digital proscenium by Jack**  
_Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an extravagant amount of mirth._

## 🌌 Premise

Welcome, wayward traveller of the web, to **enter_the_void** — a static-site experiment that straddles the line between classroom and cabaret.  
What began as a modest course hub has metastasized into something delightfully unruly: a portal of links, lectures, and luminous nonsense, all wrapped in the spectral silk of Saskatchewan Polytechnic’s palette.  

Here the author, performer, and professor (that’s me) collects the many acts of my digital life:
- 💻 **Teaching stages** — course pages, project showcases, and assorted props from the front of the lecture hall.  
- 🕹️ **Game experiments** — prototypes from *Pocket Earldom*, *Floaty Boats 2k26*, and other bouts of pixelated pandemonium.  
- 📚 **Philosophical interludes** — excerpts from *Jack’s Rules for Playing the Game of Life*, written between bouts of caffeine and clarity.

## ⚙️ Technology

- **HTML5** for the bones  
- **Bootstrap** for a touch of civilized structure  
- **CSS custom styling** because aesthetics are pedagogy  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and occasional mischief  
- **GitHub Pages** for free, effortless hosting in the ether

## 💡 Philosophy

> _“Teach as you perform, and perform as you teach.”_  
> — Jack, somewhere between a midterm and a monologue  

The site is less a portfolio and more a living rehearsal space — where code, design, and pedagogy share the same stage lights.  
Expect the occasional glitch, pun, or philosophical tangent; they’re all part of the show.

## 🚀 Deployment

The void is hosted via **GitHub Pages**, automatically rebuilt whenever I push to `main`.  
To conjure your own version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackzorvath/enter_the_void.git
